	abstract = {The study of intraindividual variability is central to the study of individuals in psychology. Previous research has related the variance observed in repeated measurements (time series) of individuals to trait-like measures that are logically related. Intraindividual measures, such as intraindividual standard deviation or the coefficient of variation, are likely to be incomplete representations of intraindividual variability. This article shows that the study of intraindividual variability can be made more productive by examining variability of interest at specific time scales, rather than considering the variability of entire time series. Furthermore, examination of variance in observed scores may not be sufficient, because these neglect the time scale dependent relationships between observations. The current article outlines a method of using estimated derivatives to examine intraindividual variability through estimates of the variance and other distributional properties at multiple time scales. In doing so, this article encourages more nuanced discussion about intraindividual variability and highlights that variability and variance are not equivalent. An example with simulated data and an example relating variability in daily measures of negative affect to neuroticism are provided.},

	abstract = {Recent research suggests that humans perceive quantity using a non-symbolic “number sense.” This sense is then thought to provide a foundation for understanding symbolic numbers in formal education. Given this link, there has been interest in the extent to which the approximate number system (ANS) can be improved via dedicated training, as this could provide a route to improving performance in symbolic mathematics. However, current evidence regarding the trainability of the ANS comes largely from studies that have used short training durations, leaving open the question of whether improvements occur over a longer time span. To address this limitation, we utilized a perceptual learning approach to investigate the extent to which long-term (8,000+ trials) training modifies the ANS. Consistent with the general methodological approach common in the domain of perceptual learning (where learning specificity is commonly observed), we also examined whether ANS training generalizes to: (a) untrained locations in the visual field; (b) an enumeration task; (c) a higher-level ratio comparison task; and (d) arithmetic ability. In contrast to previous short-term training studies showing that ANS learning quickly asymptotes, our long-term training approach revealed that performance continued to improve even after thousands of trials. We further found that the training generalized to untrained visual locations. At post-test there was non-significant evidence for generalization to a low-level enumeration task, but not to our high-level tasks, including ratio comparison, multi-object tracking, and arithmetic performance. These results demonstrate the potential utility of long-term psychophysical training, but also suggest that ANS training alone (even long-duration training) may be insufficient to modify higher-level math skills.},

	abstract = {The learning curve in perceptual learning is typically sampled in blocks of trials, which could result in imprecise and possibly biased estimates, especially when learning is rapid. Recently, Zhao, Lesmes, and Lu (2017, 2019) developed a Bayesian adaptive quick Change Detection (qCD) method to accurately, precisely, and efficiently assess the time course of perceptual sensitivity change. In this study, we implemented and tested the qCD method in assessing the learning curve in a four-alternative forced-choice global motion direction identification task in both simulations and a psychophysical experiment. The stimulus intensity in each trial was determined by the qCD, staircase or random stimulus selection (RSS) methods. Simulations showed that the accuracy (bias) and precision (standard deviation or confidence bounds) of the estimated learning curves from the qCD were much better than those obtained by the staircase and RSS method; this is true for both trial-by-trial and post hoc segment-by-segment qCD analyses. In the psychophysical experiment, the average half widths of the 68.2\% credible interval of the estimated thresholds from the trial-by-trial and post hoc segment-by-segment qCD analyses were both quite small. Additionally, the overall estimates from the qCD and staircase methods matched extremely well in this task where the behavioral rate of learning is relatively slow. Our results suggest that the qCD method can precisely and accurately assess the trial-by-trial time course of perceptual learning.},

	abstract = {Classical models of perceptual decision-making assume that subjects use a single, consistent strategy to form decisions, or that decision-making strategies evolve slowly over time. Here we present new analyses suggesting that this common view is incorrect. We analyzed data from mouse and human decision-making experiments and found that choice behavior relies on an interplay among multiple interleaved strategies. These strategies, characterized by states in a hidden Markov model, persist for tens to hundreds of trials before switching, and often switch multiple times within a session. The identified decision-making strategies were highly consistent across mice and comprised a single 'engaged' state, in which decisions relied heavily on the sensory stimulus, and several biased states in which errors frequently occurred. These results provide a powerful alternate explanation for 'lapses' often observed in rodent behavioral experiments, and suggest that standard measures of performance mask the presence of major changes in strategy across trials.},
